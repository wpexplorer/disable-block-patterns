# Disable Block Patterns
A little plugin based on our tutorial [How to Disable WordPress Patterns](https://www.wpexplorer.com/how-to-disable-wordpress-gutenberg-block-patterns/)

The plugin will remove all the core and remove patterns.

## How to Install the Plugin?
Head over to [releases](https://github.com/wpexplorer/disable-block-patterns/releases) download the latest version. Once the zip has downloaded it will have the format disable-block-patterns-{version}. You can upload this zip file, but we recommend you instead unzip the folder, rename it to just "disable-block-patterns", re-zip then upload it to your site.
